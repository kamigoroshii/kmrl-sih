Guards and covers might have been \nremoved for illustrative purposes.\nContinuing improvement and advancement of product \ndesign might have caused changes to your machine \nwhich are not included in this publication. Read, study \nand keep this manual with the machine.\nWhenever a question arises regarding your machine, or \nthis publication, please consult your Caterpillar dealer \nfor the latest available information.\nSafety\nThe safety section lists basic safety precautions. In \naddition, this section identifies the text and locations of \nwarning signs and labels used on the machine.\nRead and understand the basic precautions listed in \nthe safety section before operating or performing \nlubrication, maintenance and repair on this machine.\nOperation\nThe operation section is a reference for the new \noperator and a refresher for the experienced operator. \nThis section includes a discussion of gauges, \nswitches, machine controls, attachment controls, \ntransportation and towing information.\nPhotographs and illustrations guide the operator \nthrough correct procedures of checking, starting, \noperating and stopping the machine.\nOperating techniques outlined in this publication are \nbasic. Skill and techniques develop as the operator \ngains knowledge of the machine and its capabilities.\nMaintenance\nThe maintenance section is a guide to equipment care. \nThe Maintenance Interval Schedule (MIS) lists the \nitems to be maintained at a specific service interval. \nItems without specific intervals are listed under the \n\"When Required\" service interval. The Maintenance \nInterval Schedule lists the page number for the step-\nby-step instructions required to accomplish the \nscheduled maintenance. Use the Maintenance Interval \nSchedule as an index or \"one safe source\" for all \nmaintenance procedures.\nMaintenance Intervals\nUse the service hour meter to determine servicing \nintervals. Calendar intervals shown (daily, weekly, \nmonthly, etc.) can be used instead of service hour \nmeter intervals if they provide more convenient \nservicing schedules and approximate the indicated \nservice hour meter reading. Recommended service \nshould always be performed at the interval that occurs \nfirst.\nUnder extremely severe, dusty or wet operating \nconditions, more frequent lubrication than is specified \nin the maintenance intervals chart might be necessary.\nCertified Engine Maintenance\nProper maintenance and repair is essential to keep the \nengine and machine systems operating correctly. As the \nheavy duty off-road diesel engine owner, you are \nresponsible for the performance of the required \nmaintenance listed in the Owner Manual, Operation \nand Maintenance Manual, and Service Manual.\nIt is prohibited for any person engaged in the business \nof repairing, servicing, selling, leasing, or trading \nengines or machines to remove, alter, or render \ninoperative any emission related device or element of \ndesign installed on or in an engine or machine that is in \ncompliance with the regulations (40 CFR Part 89). \nCertain elements of the machine and engine such as \nthe exhaust system, fuel system, electrical system, \nintake air system and cooling system may be emission \nrelated and should not be altered unless approved by \nCaterpillar.\nMachine Capacity\nAdditional attachments or modifications may exceed \nmachine design capacity which can adversely affect \nperformance characteristics. Included would be stability \nand system certifications such as brakes, steering, and \nrollover protective structures (ROPS). Contact your \nCaterpillar dealer for further information.",
