Do not breathe in or come into contact with exhaust gases.\nWARNING\nCarbon monoxide is a poisonous gas. Inhalation of this gas can cause severe personal injury or\ndeath. Adhere to the following bullet points to make sure carbon monoxide is not being inhaled\nby occupants of the vehicle as well as others working on or around the generator set.\n\u2022\nInspect for exhaust leaks, and test and confirm that all carbon monoxide detectors are\nworking in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions or owner's manual, prior to\nevery startup, and after every 8 hours of running.\n\u2022\nNever occupy the vehicle while the generator set is running unless the vehicle is equipped\nwith a working carbon monoxide detector.\n\u2022\nNever operate the generator set when the vehicle is in a confined space, such as a garage,\nbasement, or building of any kind.\n\u2022\nMake sure the exhaust system is installed in accordance with the generator set installation\nmanual.\n\u2022\nNever use engine cooling air for heating a working or living space compartment.\nCarbon Monoxide (CO) is odorless, colorless, tasteless, and non-irritating. It cannot be seen or smelled.\nExposure, even to low levels of CO for a prolonged period can lead to asphyxiation (lack of oxygen).\n{Image_1 A043D713\\page_10_img_1.png description: The image is a yellow triangle with a black border, containing a black exclamation mark in the center.
