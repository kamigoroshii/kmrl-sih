Excavators are not equipped with ROPS \nstructures. Any alteration or any modification to the \nROPS/FOPS Structure could weaken the structure. \nThis places the operator into an unprotected \nenvironment. Modifications or attachments that cause \nthe machine to exceed the weight that is stamped on \nthe certification plate also place the operator into an \nunprotected environment. Excessive weight may inhibit \nthe brake performance, the steering performance and \nthe ROPS. The protection that is offered by the ROPS/\nFOPS Structure will be impaired if the ROPS/FOPS \nStructure has structural damage. Damage to the \nstructure can be caused by an overturn, a falling \nobject, a collision, etc.\nDo not mount items (fire extinguishers, first aid kits, \nwork lights, etc) by welding brackets to the ROPS/\nFOPS Structure or by drilling holes in the ROPS/FOPS \nStructure. Welding brackets or drilling holes in the \nROPS/FOPS Structures can weaken the structures. \nConsult your Caterpillar dealer for mounting guidelines.\nOther Guards (If Equipped)\nProtection from flying objects and/or falling objects is \nrequired for special applications. Logging applications \nand demolition applications are two examples that \nrequire special protection.\nA front guard needs to be installed when a work tool \nthat creates flying objects is used. Mesh front guards \nthat are approved by Caterpillar or polycarbonate front \nguards that are approved by Caterpillar are available \nfor machines with a cab or an open canopy. On \nmachines that are equipped with cabs, the windshield \nshould also be closed. Safety glasses are \nrecommended when flying hazards exist for machines \nwith cabs and machines with open canopies.\nIf the work material extends above the cab, top guards \nand front guards should be used. Typical examples of \nthis type of application are listed below:\n\u2022 Demolition applications\n\u2022 Rock quarries\n\u2022 Forestry products\nAdditional guards may be required for specific \napplications or work tools. The Operation and \nMaintenance Manual for your machine or your work \ntool will provide specific requirements for the guards. \nConsult your Caterpillar dealer for additional \ninformation.",
